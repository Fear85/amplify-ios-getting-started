# Introduction

## Overview

In this tutorial, you will create a simple iOS using AWS Amplify, a set of tools and serverless services in the cloud. In the first module, you‚Äôll build a simple iOS application. Through the remaining 4 modules, you will initialize a local app using the CLI, add authentication, add a GraphQL API and database, and update your app to store images.

## What you Will Learn

This tutorial will walk you through the steps to create a simple iOS application discussed above. You will learn:

- Manage serverless cloud backend from the command line
    
- Authentication: Add auth to your app to enable sign-in and sign-out
    
- Database and Storage: Add a GraphQL API, database, and storage solution

## Modules 

This tutorial is divided into five short modules. You must complete each module in order before moving on to the next one.

- [Create an iOS App](/02_create_ios_app.md) (10 minutes): Create an iOS app and test it in the iPhone simulator.

- Initialize a Local App (5 minutes): Initialize a local app using AWS Amplify.

- Add Authentication (10 minutes): Add auth to your application.

- Add a GraphQL API and Database (15 minutes): Create a GraphQL API.
